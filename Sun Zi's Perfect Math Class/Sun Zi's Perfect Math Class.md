### Summary of Solving Process

1. **Identify the problem:**
   - Identify the mathmatical concept being used and solve through.
   - \( x \equiv 2 \ (\text{mod} \ 3) \)
   - \( x \equiv 4 \ (\text{mod} \ 5) \)
   - \( x \equiv 5 \ (\text{mod} \ 7) \)
   - and then applying the CRT Formula (Read more here : https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/numbertheory/crt.html)


2. **Solve the complex problem:**
   -  Use the same concept but with a program for faster results. (cal.py program)
